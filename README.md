# Todo List
A project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list).
See the [live version](https://federicaercole.github.io/to-do-list/).

## Features:
- Create, edit and delete tasks
- Create, edit and delete categories
- Filter tasks by category

## What I learned in doing this project:
- Manipulate DOM
- Use classes
- Use Webpack
- Separate concerns (UI logic and app logic)
- Use modules

Certainly there's a lot to improve, like refactoring the code or adding confirmation messages, but it was a great exercise nonetheless.
